# Teaco

Teaco is a SwiftUI app designed to help special education students in my school district run a student-operated coffee cart with more independence and confidence. The goal of the app is to make the transaction process more visual, intuitive, and accessible.

## 🎯 Purpose

Traditional point-of-sale systems rely heavily on numeric input, which can be challenging for students with cognitive or processing differences. Teaco replaces numbers with **visual selections** to help students communicate, record orders, and calculate change more easily.

## 🧩 How It Works

- Students tap **images** of the products being purchased rather than typing prices.
- When cash is received, students select the **visual icons** of bills and coins.
- The app **automatically calculates change**.
- A **visual representation** shows the exact bills and coins to return, reducing cognitive load and confusion.
- An admin can access a different view by inputting the admin password, and modify the item's images, prices, names, and more, which updates to the Firebase database.

This creates a workflow that is:
- Clear and visual  
- Step-by-step and predictable  
- Supportive of memory and comprehension differences  

## 💡 Design Focus

Teaco was built with the principles of:
- **Accessibility**
- **User empowerment**
- **Simplicity and clarity**
- **Consistent visual language**

The interface prioritizes **sense-making over speed**, making it easier for users to feel successful.
